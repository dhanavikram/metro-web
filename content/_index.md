Hello and welcome! 

I’m Dhanavikram Sekar, a Data Science grad student at CU Boulder, originally from Chidambaram, India. I’m into tech (especially smartphone tech), travel, music, and movies.  

On the professional side, my interests centers on big data infrastructure—tools like Spark, Ray, and Kubernetes—and lately I'm exploring DevOps, MLOps, and SRE.

In a nutshell, I’m on a mission to make data science faster and more reliable. Thanks for visiting my space!
